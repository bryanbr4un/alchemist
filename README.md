Alchemist

About
=====
This is a simple, unfinished, javascript game, built as a personal javascript exercise. My primary aim was to muck around with object oriented principles in javascript, which I did, and it was awesome. The gameplay... not so much.

Instructions
============
To play, open index.php in a web browser, or play the [live demo at http://alchemist.bryanbraun.com](http://alchemist.bryanbraun.com).
